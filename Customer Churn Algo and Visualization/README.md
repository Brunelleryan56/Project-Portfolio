# UConn Group Project NÂº2

## Purpose
In this analysis, we will be predicting whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data; such as,
usage patterns, interaction frequency, account age, and other relevant features. 

## Goal
To accurately identify at-risk customers, allowing the business to target retention efforts effectively.

## Branching Strategy
1- Create your own branch. Use some name identifying the tasks your working on.
```git switch -c [branch name]```

2- Be free. Write your code.
3- Commit changes
```
git add .
git commit -m [message]
```

4- Push changes (Two options)
```
git push -u origin [branch name]
OR
git push
```

5- Create Pull Request (PR)
6- Someone should review the PR and accept it

### Notes for a good commit message
- Start with the type of the change: Fix, Feature, Documentation, etc.
- Very descriptive message of what changed: add a graphic showing x from this dataset. _Should start with a verb_.
