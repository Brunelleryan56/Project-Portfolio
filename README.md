# My Data Science Projects

This repository contains three of my data science projects:

1. **Real Estate Price Trend Evaluation & Visualization**
   - This project focuses on analyzing real estate price trends using historical data. 
   - Key features:
      - Data preprocessing and cleaning
      - Time series analysis and forecasting
      - Data visualization (trends, correlations, etc.)
      - [Optional: Interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly or Bokeh]
   - To run:
      1. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
      2. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA.ipynb` 

2. **Customer Churn Prediction Algorithm**
   - This project aims to predict customer churn for a given business using machine learning.
   - Key features:
      - Feature engineering (e.g., creating new features, handling categorical variables)
      - Model training and evaluation (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests)
      - Model performance analysis (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC)
   - To run:
      1. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
      2. Run the training script: `python src/model_training.py`

3. **Brain Tumor CNN Model**
   - This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify brain tumors in medical images.
   - Key features:
      - Image preprocessing (e.g., resizing, normalization, augmentation)
      - CNN model architecture (e.g., number of layers, filter sizes, activation functions)
      - Model training and evaluation on medical imaging data
   - To run:
      1. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
      2. Run the training script: `python src/train_model.py`
