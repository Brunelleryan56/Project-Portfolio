# Brain Tumor Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## **Project Overview**

This project leverages deep learning techniques to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of detecting brain tumors from MRI scans. By automating the analysis of medical images, the model aims to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing brain tumors more accurately and efficiently.

## **Purpose**

The primary purpose of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a deep learning-based system for brain tumor classification. The project aims to:
- **Improve Diagnostic Accuracy**: Ensure reliable and consistent predictions.
- **Streamline Diagnostic Processes**: Reduce the time and effort required for manual diagnosis.
- **Enhance Clinical Adoption**: Provide interpretable results that can be trusted by medical professionals.

## **Goals**

1. **Accurate Detection of Brain Tumors**  
   Develop a reliable model to classify MRI scans into tumor and non-tumor categories with high accuracy.

2. **Reduction in Diagnostic Time**  
   Automate image analysis to expedite diagnosis and treatment planning.

3. **Model Interpretability for Clinical Use**  
   Provide visual explanations for predictions to build trust and facilitate adoption in medical settings.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset), which contains MRI images categorized into four types:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **No Tumor**

### **Dataset Structure**
- **Train Folder**: Contains labeled images for training.
- **Test Folder**: Contains labeled images for testing.

Each folder is further divided into subfolders representing the categories.

## **Methodology**

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Resize images to a fixed size (128x128 pixels).
- Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].
- Apply data augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, zooming) to enhance generalization.

### 2. Model Architecture
- A **baseline CNN** with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers for feature extraction and classification.

### 3. Training and Validation
- Binary cross-entropy loss for classification.
- The Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.

### 4. Evaluation
- Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
